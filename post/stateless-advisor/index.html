<p>I find myself repeating the following advice to my mentees: Assume your manager (advisor) remembers nothing about your previous meeting. Start from the top and build back the <em>context</em> of your discussion before you dive into technical details.</p>
<p>I have dubbed this the “stateless manager model” after functional programming paradigms where the program uses no state and instead acts only upon the inputs provided to it.
There’s a couple of reasons why this advice makes sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your manager/advisor probably has dozens of technical meetings in a week and a million other things they are working on. It is quite hard for them to remember all the details of your previous conversation.</li>
<li>Even <em>if</em> they remembered what the details were, you could’ve come up with a new way to think about the problem and building context from the ground up will reveal those to your manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter skill is quite important for junior developers and researchers.
The ability to effectively and concisely articulate <em>what the problem is</em> is just as important, if not more important, than what the solution is.
In fact, a great many researchers are famous not for their ability to come up with a solution but their ability to articulate problems.
The Stateless Manager model is a particularly good way to practice this art.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: This post is not a subtweet of my current or past advisors, all of whom are blessed far better memory than me. The point of the post is that <em>even if</em> your manager remembers each conversation exactly, this is <em>still</em> a good way to structure your approach to meetings.</p>
