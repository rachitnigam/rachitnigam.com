- I cannot be happy outside academia
- If it is novel, it is useful
- If it is useful, it is publishable
- Engineering does not matter
- Presentations do not matter
- Writing does not matter
- I will build and they will come
- Pedantry and insight are the same thing
- Critiquing and creating are the same skills
- This class will help my research
- This class won't help my research
- Research area X is useless
- Research area Y is the ultimate truth
- Idea matters more than the execution
- Execution matters more than the idea
- Citation count indicates how smart someone is
- Industry does not do anything novel
- Industry does the hard 20% needed to make something real
- Everything was invented in the 80s

*Addressed to my future self*
