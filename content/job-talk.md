**Title.** Programming Systems for Designing Hardware Accelerators

**Abstract.**
Improvements to transistor design, through physical scaling laws such as Dennard's scaling and Moore's law, have provided transparent and exponential performance improvements to the computing stack for decades.
With the end of these processes in sight, next-generation systems need to use each transistor as efficiently as possible.
Hardware accelerators enable this trade-off by specializing to a particular application domain and have been widely deployed in domains from machine learning (Google TPU, AWS Inferentia) to networking (Intel Tofino, Mellanox Innova).


However, tools for building accelerators remain accessible only to experts, requiring deep domain knowledge for effective use.
My research builds new tools and abstractions for designing and using accelerators. In this talk, I will present two systems for designing accelerators: (1) Filament, a new hardware description language for modular and efficient composition of an important class of hardware circuits, and (2) [Calyx](https://calyxir.org), a compiler infrastructure for transforming high-level programs to efficient circuits.
Calyx has been adopted by the broader [LLVM CIRCT](https://circt.llvm.org/) ecosystem, where it is used to compile high-level languages like C++, PyTorch, and Halide to efficient circuits.
Filament is being investigated by the Jane Street hardware acceleration team and Google's XLS project as an integration language.
Together, these systems represent a step towards my vision of building a large-scale ecosystem for hardware design, where users of all expertise can use appropriate abstractions, reuse components, and build efficient accelerators.
I will conclude by discussing challenges with the complementary goal of designing abstractions for using accelerators.


**Biography.** Rachit Nigam (he/him) is a PhD student at Cornell University and a visiting scholar at MIT working on new programming systems for designing and using hardware accelerators. His research is supported by the Jane Street Fellowship and has been highlighted at MIT's PL review. Rachit is the founder of PLTea (https://pltea.github.io/), a virtual, worldwide organization for people interested in programming languages, and enjoys building open-source tools, from little scripts to large-scale infrastructures.

## Logistics

**Length.** The expected length of my talk is **45-minutes**. Please let me know in advance if you would like a shorter or longer talk.

**Presentation.** I am planning to present my talk on my personal laptop which has HDMI and USB-C ports. If I am expected to present on a different laptop or need to connect to different display interfaces, please let me know ASAP.

**Recording.** In general, I am happy to have the talk recorded for internal usage of the department. If your department is planning to publicly publish a version of my talk, please let me know in advance.

## Accommodation Requests
I am currently recovering from a recent illness. I would appreciate the following accommodations.

**Dietary Restrictions.**
I am not eating dairy, raw foods (sushi etc.), and extremely spicy foods. I am generally also avoiding extremely caffeinated drinks but am still happy to accompany folks to coffee or tea shops.

**Schedule.**
I would like a 15-minute break every two hours to eat a light snack and become hydrated.
