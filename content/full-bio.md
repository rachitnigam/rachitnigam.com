Hi! I'm Rachit Nigam{% footnote() %}
*Pronunciation*: Ruh-CHITH NI-gum. First name rhymes with "crutch-it".
{% end %}. I am starting as an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2025-26 academic year.
I am currently wrapping up my PhD at Cornell University working with [Adrian Sampson][adrian].
I was previously a visiting scholar at MIT with [Jonathan Ragan-Kelley][jrk].
Before that, I spent a year at the [UW PLSE][plse] group as a visiting scholar.

**Research&nbsp;** My thesis research has produced three systems:
* Calyx: A compiler infrastructure for compiling high-level languages to efficient circuits. Calyx has been adopted by the [LLVM CIRCT][circt] project and is the basis for several academic and research tools.
* Filament: a new hardware description language that uses a novel type system to guarantee correctness of pipeline composition. Filament's ideas have influenced the design of Google's [XLS][] system and Jane Street's [HardCaml][] language.
* Dahlia, a high-level language for predictable accelerator generation. Dahlia demonstrated how type systems can connect high-level abstractions with circuit-level constraints.

**PLTea&nbsp;** I started [PLTea][] during PLDI '20 in hopes of keeping social interactions alive during virtual conferences. PLTea now has over 400 members, meets monthly, has been organized several times with various PL conferences ([PLDI '22][plt-pldi22], [ICFP '21][plt-icfp21], [SPLASH '21][plt-oopsla21], [PLDI '21][plt-pldi21]) and has inspired spin-offs in other communities ([ArchChat][]).

**Personal&nbsp;** I am a classically trained [Tabla][] player and have a continuing obsession with synthesizers and digital audio workstations.
When the weather allows for it, I go on long bike rides, often in search of little oddities.
