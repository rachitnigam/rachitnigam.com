*Pronunciation*: Ruh-CHITH NI-gum. First name rhymes with "crutch-it".
{% end %}
is a visiting researcher in the [PLSE][plse] group at University of Washington
and a PhD candidate studying computer science at Cornell University.

He is a part of the [CAPRA][] and [PL@Cornell][pl-cornell] research groups and is advised by [Adrian Sampson][adrian].
His research ([Dahlia][], [Calyx][]) is focused on building high-level programming models for designing hardware accelerators.
He previously worked in the [PLASMA][plasma] research group at the University of Massachusetts Amherst with [Arjun Guha][arjun].

Rachit started [PLTea](https://pltea.github.io/) during PLDI '20 in hopes of keeping social interactions alive during virtual conferences. PLTea has since been organized several times ([PLDI '22][plt-pldi22], [ICFP '21][plt-icfp21], [SPLASH '21][plt-oopsla21], [PLDI '21][plt-pldi21]) and has inspired spin-offs in other communities ([ArchChat][]).
