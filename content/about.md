I am an incoming professor at MIT in the EECS department where I will lead the [Flame Lab][flame].
My goal is to build systems that democratize the *design* and *use* of specialized hardware.
I am excited to work with folks who are dissatisfied with the current state of tools and techniques for hardware design.
I am interested in radically new approaches that combine ideas from programming languages, computer architecture, VLSI, and computer-aided design to address the design, verification, and usability challenges of specialized hardware.
In doing so, I want to build real systems, evaluate them rigorously, and get other people to use them.

My PhD research has produced three systems:
* [Calyx][]: A compiler infrastructure for compiling high-level languages to efficient circuits. Calyx has been adopted by the [LLVM CIRCT][circt] project and is the basis for several academic and research tools.
* [Filament][]: a new hardware description language that uses a novel type system to guarantee correctness of pipeline composition. Filament's ideas have influenced the design of Google's [XLS][] system and Jane Street's [HardCaml][] language.
* [Dahlia]: A high-level language for predictable accelerator generation. Dahlia demonstrated how type systems can connect high-level abstractions with circuit-level constraints.
