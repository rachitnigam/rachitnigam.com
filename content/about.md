Rachit Nigam{% footnote() %}
*Pronunciation*: Ruh-CHITH NI-gum. First name rhymes with "crutch-it".
{% end %}
is a visiting researcher at [MIT CSAIL][csail] working with [Jonathan Ragan-Kelley][jrk] and a PhD candidate at [Cornell University][cornell] working with [Adrian Sampson][adrian].


His research ([Filament][], [Calyx][], [Dahlia][]) is focused on building high-level programming models for designing hardware accelerators and is supported through the [Jane Street Fellowship][js-fellow].
He has previously been affiliated with the [UW PLSE lab][plse], [Brown's PLT group][brown-plt], and the [PLASMA research group][plasma] at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Rachit started [PLTea](https://pltea.github.io/) during PLDI '20 in hopes of keeping social interactions alive during virtual conferences. PLTea has since been organized several times ([PLDI '22][plt-pldi22], [ICFP '21][plt-icfp21], [SPLASH '21][plt-oopsla21], [PLDI '21][plt-pldi21]) and has inspired spin-offs in other communities ([ArchChat][]).
