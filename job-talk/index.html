<p><strong>Title.</strong> Programming Systems for Designing Hardware Accelerators</p>
<p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
Improvements to transistor design, through physical scaling laws such as Dennard’s scaling and Moore’s law, have provided transparent and exponential performance improvements to the computing stack for decades.
With the end of these processes in sight, next-generation systems need to use each transistor as efficiently as possible.
Hardware accelerators enable this trade-off by specializing to a particular application domain, and have been widely deployed in domains from machine learning (Google TPU, AWS Inferentia) to networking (Intel Tofino, Mellanox Innova).</p>
<p>However, tools for building accelerators remain accessible only to experts, requiring deep domain knowledge for effective use.
Through the lens of modularity, my research builds new programming systems for accelerator design that enable users of different expertise to efficiently design and optimize hardware accelerators for their needs.
I will discuss two systems in this talk.
First, Filament, a new hardware description language that uses a novel type system to enable modular reasoning of hardware designs and eliminates a large class of bugs at compile-time.
Second, Calyx, a modular compiler infrastructure that transforms high-level languages, like C++, Halide, and PyTorch, and optimizes them to produce efficient hardware designs.
I will conclude by discussing next steps towards building a large-scale ecosystem for hardware design and the challenges with the complementary goal of designing abstractions for using accelerators.</p>
<p><strong>Biography.</strong> Rachit Nigam (he/him) is a PhD student at Cornell University and a visiting scholar at MIT working on new programming systems for designing and using hardware accelerators.
His research is supported by a Jane Street Fellowship and has adopted by broad open-source communities such as the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://circt.llvm.org">LLVM CIRCT</a> project and by industrial teams at Google and Jane Street.
Rachit is the founder of PLTea (https://pltea.github.io/), a virtual, worldwide organization for people interested in programming languages.</p>

<p><strong>Length.</strong> The expected length of my talk is <strong>45-minutes</strong>. Please let me know in advance if you would like a shorter or longer talk.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation.</strong> I am planning to present my talk on my personal laptop which has HDMI and USB-C ports. If I am expected to present on a different laptop or need to connect to different display interfaces, please let me know ASAP.</p>
<p><strong>Recording.</strong> In general, I am happy to have the talk recorded for internal usage of the department. If your department is planning to publicly publish a version of my talk, please let me know in advance.</p>
<h2 id="accommodation-requests">Accommodation Requests</h2>
<p>I am currently recovering from a recent illness. I would appreciate the following accommodations.</p>
<p><strong>Dietary Restrictions.</strong>
I am not eating dairy, raw foods (sushi etc.), and extremely spicy foods. I am generally also avoiding extremely caffeinated drinks but am still happy to accompany folks to coffee or tea shops.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule.</strong>
I would like a 15-minute break every two hours to eat a light snack.</p>
